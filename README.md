Hello! I'm Flora Key (***it/its**; if you know this, please do not refer to me otherwise*). I'm a self-taught software developer, visual artist, and writer. I'm a nonhuman, plural[^1], intersex[^2], queer, and disabled[^3] robot/dog/girl[^4]. I make programs based off of things that I would like to use or have, and share them in the hopes that others might also enjoy them.
